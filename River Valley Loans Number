River Valley Loans Number

The lender typically runs a “soft pull” on your credit and analyzes the information in your application, including debt-to-income ratio (DTI), to determine if you qualify for a loan. The lender will also share the APR and loan terms it can offer if you qualify for funding.

If you choose to move forward with the application, lenders conduct a “hard pull” on your credit history and might ask you for additional documentation to make a final decision.

Unconventional personal loan lenders also evaluate your creditworthiness and DTI, but they may weigh those factors differently. They may also approve you based on things like your career or college degree.
