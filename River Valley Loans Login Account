Like a traditional personal loan, an unconventional personal loan lets you borrow a fixed amount of money from a lender. You’ll need to repay the loan, plus interest charges that accrue, within an agreed-upon time frame. The borrowed funds can be used toward upcoming purchases, like a car repair or medical bills.

Unconventional personal loans, however, differ in two key ways: The money is borrowed from nontraditional lenders, such as marketplace lenders, that focus on unconventional factors to evaluate the loan applicant. Consequently, you could get approved for funding even if you wouldn’t qualify at a traditional bank.
